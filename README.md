# ReactNative-Reminder-App
A 24hour pure React Native challenge.

I've used React for less than 3 months and around 1 months for React Native. Since I will be starting the junior year of university soon, I would like to challenge myself.
Personally, I sometimes forgot the task that I should do and one of my closest person also told me that I should remind myself with something. I, therefore, wanted to created a basic
reminder app for myself.

Almost 24 hours later, the app turns out more like a To-Do List application and not a reminder application since there is no time selection and push notification. Even though I would like
to implement it, but I have a quick errand to run after the completion of my app (9AM of 8 August 2021) to 11AM. So I would like to end the development of this application here.

This is my first time using pure React Native (with out the use of Expo) and it's a pretty good experience so far.

Feel free to Fork this basic application :D
PS. Please let me know if I can improve any line of codes, since I begin this project as a personal challenge and a as a quest to learn more React Native!
